#Journal Entry Reading 06

**In** the chapter, we were shown how to attatch .js and .css files to our html file, so that we can add styling and scripting, making our website more exciting and raise the capabilities.

##CSS
They did this by having us enter:
    <link rel-"stylesheet" href="css/c01.css" />
        - Note that this was added within the <head> tag of the html, which is where we put 

This means that a **link** with the relation name *Stylesheet* is being requested by the hyperreference (file location markup) **_css/c01.css_**

##Javascript
For javascript, they had us attatch the <script> markup nearer to the bottom of the page.
- This is due to the way that your browser will read the <html> file. By running the html in full prior to any scripting events, you reduce the risk of .html not loading prior to changes that the .js file will change

        <script src= "js/add-content.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>


**Overall** this was a pretty neat way to see how *both* CSS and JavaScript change how a website can appear, as well as what text will be shown on the final product!
