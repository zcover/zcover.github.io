# Zerek Cover's About me Page
Hello! My name is Zerek, and I've got a great story to be told, and yet- my life is only just beginning!
Despite that, I have already begun a new path, a path of coding! Hopefully you find this to be inetersting, and I hope you enjoy your journey with me through my coding career!

Before we get too far ahead, please feel free to visit my [Github Profile page!](https://github.com/zcover)


## A little about me

I have a few unique features of my life, some of which I shared in class on monday!
Here are just a few more interesting things to share about myself:
- I am the oldest of 5, with an extended married-in siblings, making me 3rd in line out of 8 total children.
- I am the older brother of Triplets, who are 10 years younger than me, and are becoming Juniors in Highschool! (Scary!!!)
- When I was born, I had a condition **resulting in the need to remove 2/3 of my right-lung at birth**
  -Despite the previous point, I excelled in JROTC throughout high school, managing to run a nearly 6-minute mile my Senior year!
  
  
## Coding 102 (Day 1)

My first step to becoming a computer software engineer/developer. Today we covered a lot about how <codefellows> plans to teach us, as well as ways that they have found we, as students, actually *learn*.
  
   ### Growth Mindset
  Probably the most important thing to have been brought up today, was the focus of "Growth Mindset." This is the mindset that we as humans learn in a progressive manner. 
  - *Talent* does not inherently exist, but is simply a visual state of understanding. People are diverse, and therefore will understand *things* in different ways, and at varying levels of scope. **Everything can be learned, and everyone can master everything.**
  - Someone who has tuned their mindset in-line that of the *"Growth Mindset"* are more likely to have an understanding and commitment to the term ***"No pain, no gain"***
  - The most important thing I gained from this introduction of the Growth Mindset, was the negative things I can do in my life to close off this growth, and that turning away from challenges, or giving up at the signs of difficulty or lack of clarity, create a **fixed** mindset, and hinder my learning capabilities.



# The Journal
My instructor wants me to now create a journal describing things that I have learned. From the way he has been talking about it, the most important thing to have taken from today's class, is understanding the _A-C-P_ process of github.

### ACP 
A-C-P is the process in which we pull a repository from github, make changes from the git file, and submit the edited file to the repo owner. The file typing, although maybe not in file type, is a git file. This means that the file is recording changes done to it, even if those changes arent reflected on the __head__, or main/visible file.

Although the **ACP** process is formatted as instructions, starting with A and giong to P, there is actually 2 additional _git_ commands which we utilize in the process.

- git *clone* _"link"_ (without the quotations) will pull the specified repo from the github website. 
You will then be able to identify and enter the specified folder containing the files you wish to view or edit.

- git *status* will let you know where you're at in regards to a git file's condition. Has it been edited? Have those edits been commited [to stone?] Or is the file awaiting re-upload to the "mothership" that is the original repo file? *git status* will give you an idea of where you left off.

**Now** that we've covered the 2 special commands, lets focus on the big 3!
- **A** "add" This command is used after you clone, or download the file to your local device. This is the first command that allows you to begin editing, or making changes to, the file in question.
- **C** "commit" The commit command basically sets into stone the changes you made. It *commits* your decisions to the file, basically the "save" function when dealing with git files.
- **P** Now that the file has been pulled into your local storage, a specific file has been selected for edeting, and finally we have commit any and all changes to the file, it is now time to **_Push_** the file back up to the Github repository. This finalizes and allows the changes made to be visible on the **head** page/file.

### Text Editors/IDE's

**Text Editors**

- Text Editors are programs of software which literally allow the user to edit text, allowing the creation of CSS and html files. They literally edit text, which allows you to begin typing up forms of code, and then put those pieces of code into the expected program or software to run, test, or debug what was written.
- Not all Text Editors are created equal, as all 3 of the primary operating systems (Linux, Microsoft, Mac) come with a *bare-bones* version of text editor. 
- More advanced, and at times at a higher-than-free cost, editors can also be used to run, test, and/or debug code, such as VS Code that we are using in this 102 class.

**IDE**

- Ide stands for *Integrated Development Environment*. These are application softwares that consist of a variety of tools surrounding a higher-grade text editor, for the explicit purpose of writing and developing code. 
- The example used in the context put it in an easy to understand format:
*"You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If youâ€™ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one software package."*
This means that it basically wraps a whole studio of developer's tools and featuers into one location.
- An IDE is not something that one who is new to coding should use, I think, as it would likely overwhelm the user who is not used to so many tools, which may limit the understanding of code, and/or simply get lost in all of the different tools and settings available, without any comparison or prior knowledge to understand purpose.

##Command Line

**The Command Terminal** is a tool within operating systems, which allow file navigation, execution, and all other files or directory *things*. The reason this is important to know, is because it is not always used by the user. Most users are familiar with the "File Explorer", or "My Computer" tools, which displays files and directories, and where changes can be made. 

- The file explorer and Command Terminal are basically the same thing, but without a gui

**gui** stands for **_Graphical User Interface_**. This literally means that it is user interface with a graphic (visual) overlay.

**Shortcuts**
Below are some of the bash commands that I felt the need to write down or commit to memory for my benefeit.

- *ls and ls -"Directory"* will show the contents of the current directy you are in, or by doing -l and entering a specific directory, will display the contents of *that* directory.
- *cd* is the "back button" of the bash interface. Typing cd .. or cd ../.. will take you out 2 or more times back.
  - *cd* followed by the desired directory name will move the user into the selected folder. Example: *cd testfolder* will take you into the folder (directory) named "testfolder"
- *pwd* Shows you which directory the user is currently in. 
- *mkdir* will create a directory, which can also be known as a folder that you put files into.
- *touch* Creates a file within the selected directory. The created file can be saved as a particular file type, examples include .txt, .css, .html, etc.

The only other commands I would put onto this list, are the previously mentioned *git* commands.



### html and CSS



### Introduction to JavaScript
- JavaScript is the first _actual_ coding we'll be getting into. It is logic based, rather than string based. HTML and CSS simply **_do_** things, because they're _basically_ pre-programmed to do things. 
  - JavaScript is different in that it can do things in many different ways, if we make it think it can, using logical syntax.
