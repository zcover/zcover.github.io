# Zerek Cover's About me Page
Hello! My name is Zerek, and I've got a great story to be told, and yet- my life is only just beginning!
Despite that, I have already begun a new path, a path of coding! Hopefully you find this to be inetersting, and I hope you enjoy your journey with me through my coding career!

Before we get too far ahead, please feel free to visit my [Github Profile page!](https://github.com/zcover)


## A little about me

I have a few unique features of my life, some of which I shared in class on monday!
Here are just a few more interesting things to share about myself:
- I am the oldest of 5, with an extended married-in siblings, making me 3rd in line out of 8 total children.
- I am the older brother of Triplets, who are 10 years younger than me, and are becoming Juniors in Highschool! (Scary!!!)
- When I was born, I had a condition **resulting in the need to remove 2/3 of my right-lung at birth**
  -Despite the previous point, I excelled in JROTC throughout high school, managing to run a nearly 6-minute mile my Senior year!
  
  
## Coding 102 (Day 1)

My first step to becoming a computer software engineer/developer. Today we covered a lot about how <codefellows> plans to teach us, as well as ways that they have found we, as students, actually *learn*.
  
   ### Growth Mindset
  Probably the most important thing to have been brought up today, was the focus of "Growth Mindset." This is the mindset that we as humans learn in a progressive manner. 
  - *Talent* does not inherently exist, but is simply a visual state of understanding. People are diverse, and therefore will understand *things* in different ways, and at varying levels of scope. **Everything can be learned, and everyone can master everything.**
  - Someone who has tuned their mindset in-line that of the *"Growth Mindset"* are more likely to have an understanding and commitment to the term ***"No pain, no gain"***
  - The most important thing I gained from this introduction of the Growth Mindset, was the negative things I can do in my life to close off this growth, and that turning away from challenges, or giving up at the signs of difficulty or lack of clarity, create a **fixed** mindset, and hinder my learning capabilities.
